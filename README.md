## Status

Currently the user is able to login. Once logged in they are granted access to the invoice tab as well as the ability to generate a detailed invoice with email integration.

While certain functions of the app are currently in the testing phase, the following will give insight to the future functionality of Invoice Me:

* User will be able to create a personal profile page as well as pages for their individual clients
* User will be able to reset password
* User will be able to send payment requests to their clients
* The user's clients will then have the opportunity to send payments through a link in the invoice
* User will be able to send payment/overdue payment notices to their clients.
